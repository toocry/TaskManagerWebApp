For a simple website capable of managing articles with basic CRUD operations in Django using an SQLite database, you can specify the following tech stack in your project documentation or job application:

# Tech Stack:

- Framework: Django 
    Django is a high-level Python web framework that provides robust tools for building web applications, including built-in support for database models, authentication, and a powerful admin interface.
- Database: SQLite
    SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, and lightweight relational database management system. It's an excellent choice for small to medium-sized web applications and is the default database used by Django.
- Programming Language: Python

    Python is the primary programming language for Django development. It offers readability, ease of use, and a vast ecosystem of libraries and packages.
- Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    HTML is used for structuring web pages.
    CSS is used for styling the web pages.
    JavaScript can be used for adding interactivity to your website.

- Template Engine: Django Template Language
    Django comes with its own template language for rendering dynamic HTML pages. It simplifies the process of creating HTML templates with dynamic content.

- Version Control: Git
    Git is a widely used distributed version control system that helps you track changes to your codebase and collaborate with others effectively.

- Development Environment: Virtual Environment
    Creating a virtual environment allows you to isolate your project's dependencies and maintain a clean and organized development environment.

- Deployment (Optional): Heroku, AWS, or PythonAnywhere
    Depending on your hosting preferences, you can deploy your Django project to platforms like Heroku, AWS (Amazon Web Services), or PythonAnywhere. These platforms provide hosting solutions and offer convenient deployment options for Django applications.

- Additional Libraries and Packages (as needed):
    django-crispy-forms for improved form rendering.

- Pillow for image processing (if your articles include images).
    whitenoise for serving static files efficiently in production.

- Any other Django or Python packages that enhance your project's functionality.
- Testing Framework (Optional): Django's built-in testing framework
  Django provides a testing framework for creating and running tests to ensure the correctness of your application.

- Database Management Tool (Optional): Django Admin Interface
    Django's admin interface can be used for managing database records during development and testing.

- Authentication (Optional): Django's built-in authentication system

    Django provides a user authentication system that can be extended to handle user registration, login, and access control.

- Version Control Repository (Optional): GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.
    Using a version control repository makes it easier to collaborate with team members and track changes to your project.
- Documentation Tool (Optional): Sphinx, ReadTheDocs, or others

    Documenting your project's code and usage can be essential for future maintenance and collaboration.
